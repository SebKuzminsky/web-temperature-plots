A small project to play with web technologies in Rust.

This project builds a small wasm web app using [yew](https://yew.rs/)
and [plotters](https://plotters-rs.github.io/home/#!/).  The web app
runs in a browser and gets temperature information over websockets from
a small server running on the network.
